    Added a new data class, 'ContentPart', it is designed to store any kind of data type related to the content of a 'ChatMessage'.
    For now, it just supports images (as image urls or base64 encoded images) and text.
    It has OpenAI Chat API specific formatting.

    Now 'ChatMessage' allows you to add 'ContentPart' as content or a list of 'str' and 'ContentPart', OpenAI Chat API
    specific formatting and serialization was updated to support this feature.

    Finally, 'ChatPromptBuilder' has been updated to support the multi modal capabilities of 'ChatMessage'.
